# Background

#### Challenges and Current State in Japan's Social Sector

Japan's social sector (including foundations, NPOs, and citizen groups) faces several challenges in terms of funding distribution mechanisms and trust, despite actively addressing many social issues. The specific problems include:

1. Lack of Transparency and Bias in Funding Distribution\
   In the current centralized grant and donation distribution system, decision-making is delegated to a limited number of authorities, making the support process closed. This has led to a situation where innovative new initiatives and minority voices struggle to be heard.

2. Stagnation in the Donation Market\
   The small size of the donation market is partly due to a lack of transparency in fund flows and usage. This has resulted in a lack of donor trust, ultimately hindering the growth of donations.

3. Weak Citizen Participation\
   Compared to other countries, citizen participation in social activities in Japan is low. This is because the role and significance of each citizen in addressing social issues is not fully recognized.

#### Potential of Decentralized Funding Distribution

Decentralized funding distribution offers new solutions to these challenges. This model utilizes blockchain technology and algorithms to enable donors and citizens to directly participate in decision-making. This is expected to bring about the following changes:

* Enhanced Transparency and Fairness\
   By making the funding distribution process public and allowing donors and citizens to track fund flows, trust can be improved.

* Reflection of Small Voices\
   By effectively incorporating small donations and local community opinions, decision-making that leverages diverse perspectives becomes possible.

* Promotion of Citizen Participation\
   When donation actions are perceived not just as financial contributions but as direct involvement in solving social issues, citizen engagement increases.

These effects have already been demonstrated in several overseas cases. For example, Gitcoin Grants' Quadratic Funding model and the joint project between UNICEF and Gitcoin have effectively utilized small donations to achieve transparency and fairness in funding distribution.
