# Guidebook Purpose

This guidebook aims to provide Japanese social sector organizations with a path to understand decentralized funding mechanisms and implement them through small-scale experiments. The specific objectives are as follows:

#### Promoting Small-Scale Experiments

The Japanese social sector still has limited experience and success stories in implementing decentralized funding. Therefore, we first support experimental implementation in small projects and local events. Specific examples include:

* Local Event Trials\
  Introducing participatory budget allocation to verify community-driven funding models.

* Small Donation Experiments\
  Utilizing Quadratic Funding to test how small donations affect project evaluation and fund distribution.

Through this, we aim to accumulate success stories and challenges, building a foundation for future large-scale implementation.

#### Forming a "Common Language" for Decentralized Funding

The guidebook provides a "common language" as a foundation for discussions about decentralized funding. This brings the following effects:

* Promoting Knowledge Sharing\
  Practitioners from different positions such as foundations, NPOs, and local governments can discuss based on a common framework.

* Learning and Improvement Cycle\
  It is possible to provide feedback on insights gained through experiments and evolve the guidebook's content.

#### Building and Disseminating Japan-Specific Models

In the long term, we aim to localize decentralized funding to suit the Japanese social sector and share the results with the world. Specifically, this includes building models that leverage characteristics such as an aging society and local governance.
