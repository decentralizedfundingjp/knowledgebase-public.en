#### Overview

The delegated review model is a system where donors and citizens elect reviewers (allocators) who are experts in specific fields through voting, and these reviewers distribute grants. This model aims to maintain community-led decision-making while utilizing expertise.

**Features**
* Balance of expertise and decentralization: Reviewers with specialized knowledge handle grant allocation
* Efficient decision-making: Streamlined review process
* Community oversight: Allocators' actions are monitored by the community, with possible replacement through no-confidence motions

***

#### Application Scenarios

* Fields requiring expertise: Areas needing advanced specialized knowledge such as healthcare, environmental conservation, education
* Large-scale grant programs: Cases with numerous candidate projects
* Efficient resource management: Optimizing fund allocation by field

***

#### Required Resources

* Allocator selection
  * Listing trustworthy candidates with specialized knowledge
* Voting platform
  * Example: Highly transparent voting systems like Snapshot
* Grant management tools
  * Dashboard for sharing review results and progress
