# Changes Realized Through Decentralized Funding

By introducing decentralized funding, we can achieve innovative changes that were not possible with traditional funding distribution models. This section outlines the specific benefits:

## Enhanced Fairness and Transparency

Traditional models often lacked transparency in review criteria and fund usage, which undermined trust among donors and citizens. Decentralized funding addresses this issue.

### Ensuring Transparency
By utilizing blockchain technology, voting results and fund flows are made public, eliminating fraud and suspicion. This allows donors to confidently verify how their funds are being used.

### Fair Evaluation
Small voices and small donations are evaluated based on transparent rules. For example, in Quadratic Funding, projects that collect many small donations are highly valued and have an increased chance of receiving funds.

## Introduction of Participatory Decision-Making

Centralized decision-making often struggled to reflect the opinions of donors and local residents. Decentralized funding provides mechanisms to fundamentally change this.

### Promoting Citizen Participation
By allowing donors and citizens to participate in decision-making, they can directly reflect their opinions and values. This transforms funding distribution from mere support actions into active engagement in solving social issues.

### Integration of Diverse Perspectives
Through community voting and delegated review committees, it becomes possible to make decisions that combine expert knowledge with citizen perspectives.

## Evaluation of Small Voices and Support

In traditional funding distribution, large-scale projects and influential organizations were prioritized, often overshadowing small voices. Decentralized funding solves this problem.

### Supporting Small-Scale Projects
Even small donations and proposals are fairly evaluated through voting and algorithms, expanding the scope of social issue solutions.

### Addressing Diverse Issues
Mechanisms that allow donors to direct funds to themes they are interested in enable responses to niche social issues.
