# What is Decentralized Funding

Decentralized funding refers to funding distribution models that allow donors and citizens to directly participate in decision-making based on specific rules and algorithms, rather than having decisions made unilaterally by specific reviewers or organizations.

Traditional centralized funding models often relied on the judgment of a few authority figures, leading to issues of bias and lack of transparency. In contrast, decentralized models have the following characteristics:

* Transparency: All processes are public, and anyone can verify the flow of funds.
* Fairness: Mechanisms are in place to properly evaluate small donations and small-scale projects.
* Participatory Decision-Making: Donors and citizens participate in decision-making, reflecting more diverse perspectives.

Specific methods include Quadratic Funding (QF), Community Voting, and Delegated Review, which have already proven successful in various cases overseas.
