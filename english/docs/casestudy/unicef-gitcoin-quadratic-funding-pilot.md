# UNICEF-Gitcoin Quadratic Funding Pilot

**Overview**

A pilot project implementing a new funding distribution model called "Quadratic Funding (QF)" for social contribution projects, conducted through collaboration between UNICEF and Gitcoin. The project aimed to achieve more effective fund distribution while ensuring transparency and fairness through blockchain technology.

**Year of Implementation**

2021

**Operators**

* UNICEF Innovation Fund
* Gitcoin

**Target Areas**

* Education
* Healthcare
* Environmental Protection
* Social Inclusion

**Objectives**

* Demonstrate decentralized funding distribution model
* Ensure transparency through blockchain technology
* Enhance the value of small donations
* Establish community-driven decision-making processes

**Results**

* Total funds raised: 132.5 ETH
* Number of donors: Over 15,500
* Number of supported projects: 12
* Average donation amount: Approximately 0.0085 ETH

## Fund Distribution Model

**Quadratic Funding (QF) Mechanism**

* Basic Concept:
  * The square root of each donor's contribution is summed, and the square of this sum is distributed as matching funds
  * This allows small donations from many people to have significant impact
* Calculation Formula:
  * Matching amount = (Σ√donation amount)²
  * Example: Comparing 10 people donating 1 ETH each vs. 100 people donating 0.1 ETH each
    * Former: (√1 × 10)² = 100
    * Latter: (√0.1 × 100)² = 1000
    * The latter receives 10 times more matching funds

**Operational Process**

1. Project Selection:
   * Projects selected from UNICEF Venture Fund
   * Each project sets clear goals and outcome indicators

2. Matching Pool Setup:
   * UNICEF provides initial matching pool
   * Additional donations from community also accepted

3. Donation Collection:
   * Donations collected through Gitcoin platform
   * Donors can contribute to multiple projects simultaneously

4. Distribution Calculation:
   * Matching funds calculated based on QF algorithm
   * Final allocation amount determined for each project

5. Results Publication:
   * Results published on blockchain
   * Ensures transparency and verifiability
