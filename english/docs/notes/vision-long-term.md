# Long-term Vision

Decentralized funding is not merely a temporary method but an important step in redesigning the future of fund distribution across society. This section explains the long-term vision from the following three perspectives.

#### Standardization of Fair and Transparent Fund Distribution

In the current social sector, fund distribution processes are often closed and opaque, undermining trust among donors and citizens. Decentralized funding functions as a mechanism to enhance transparency and enable fair fund distribution.

* Visualization of Fund Distribution Processes\
  By completely publicizing review criteria and fund flows through technologies like blockchain, opacity is eliminated, and all stakeholders can experience fairness.
* Ensuring Fairness\
  Mechanisms are established to distribute funds not only to large-scale projects but also to small-scale, innovative activities and new entrants. This expands the possibilities for solving social issues.
* Expansion of the Donation Market\
  As reliability improves, donors and supporters increase, resulting in the growth of the donation market. Transparency and fairness become key to enhancing donor engagement.

#### Development of Community-Led "Decentralized Public Goods"

Decentralized funding holds great potential for the creation and maintenance of public goods led by local residents. This approach brings new vitality to local governance and community activities.

* Participatory Fund Distribution\
  In local events and small-scale infrastructure development, residents' involvement in decision-making through voting and proposals enhances the transparency and reliability of fund distribution.
* Promotion of Local Issue Resolution\
  Projects that directly reflect residents' needs and perspectives will be implemented for region-specific issues. For example, utilization in disaster recovery support and environmental conservation projects is expected.
* Strengthening Community Connections\
  Decentralized funding also functions as a means to strengthen cooperation among residents and community bonds. By sharing projects from planning to implementation, sustainable local communities are formed.

#### Establishment and Dissemination of Japan-Originated Fund Distribution Models

Building decentralized funding models adapted to Japan's unique social challenges and culture and sharing them internationally is also a long-term goal.

* Development of Localized Models\
  Considering the characteristics of an aging society and local governments, we build Japan-specific fund distribution models. For example, developing voting platforms that are easy for elderly people to use and fund-raising mechanisms that utilize local resources.
* International Dissemination and Leadership\
  Sharing successful models from Japan internationally serves as a reference for fund distribution models in other countries' social sectors and public goods fields. This is expected to position Japan as a leader in new social issue resolution methods.

* Global Cycle of Learning and Improvement\
  Based on success stories in Japan, collaborating with international practitioners to obtain feedback enables further improvements and enhances the sustainability of the models.
