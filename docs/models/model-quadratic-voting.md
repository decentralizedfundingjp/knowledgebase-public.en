# Quadratic Voting (QV)

#### Summary

**Practitioners**
* Foundations and funds
* Political institutions and local governments

**Purpose**
* Make it easier to reflect minority opinions of voters
* Improve fairness in decision-making processes
* Prevent concentration of influence by a subset of voters

**Required Resources**
* Voting platform
  * Highly transparent tools such as Snapshot, Tally
* Governance operation support
  * Teams and tools for managing voting processes and ensuring transparency
* Education and dissemination costs
  * Materials and guidelines for voters to understand the mechanism

***

#### Overview

Quadratic Voting (QV) is a voting method that adopts a mechanism where costs increase proportionally to the number of votes when voters purchase votes. This enables fair decision-making without ignoring minority opinions.

**Features**
* Strengthens voting fairness and prevents minority opinions from being ignored
* Prevents domination by a subset of voters through cost increases
* Can utilize smart contracts and voting platforms as technical infrastructure

***

#### Benefits

* Reflection of Minority Opinions: As costs increase with the number of votes, individual votes are cast carefully, and minority opinions are respected
* Enhanced Transparency: Voting processes and results are public, and all participants can verify the results
* Fair Decision-Making: Reduces the risk of large-scale opinions being prioritized and reflects diverse perspectives in decision-making

***

#### Success Stories

**Democratic Primary Project**
* Background: QV was adopted in some U.S. states for residents to determine policy proposal priorities
* Results: By allowing participants to allocate votes across multiple policy candidates, minority opinions were appropriately reflected, leading to fair policy decisions

**Colorado State House Decision-Making**
* Background: The Colorado State Legislature experimentally introduced QV for specific budget allocations and project selections
* Results: Achieved decision-making that considered minority opinions based on discussions among legislators

***

#### Implementation Steps

1. Goal Setting and Rule Design
   * Clarify QV objectives and scope
   * Design algorithm for vote cost increases

2. Voting Platform Implementation
   * Example: Snapshot, Tally

3. Voter Education and Engagement
   * Provide workshops and materials explaining the voting system and mechanism

4. Voting and Tallying
   * Publish results in real-time while ensuring transparency

5. Feedback and Reflection of Results
   * Determine priorities and fund allocation based on voting results

***

#### Keys to Success

* Ensuring Transparency: Voting process should be verifiable by anyone
* Sharing the Importance of Minority Opinions: Help understand the value of minority opinions through educational activities
* Implementing User-Friendly Voting Systems: Provide interfaces that allow voters to participate easily

***

#### Tools

* Snapshot
  * Voting platform for decentralized governance
* Tally
  * Open-source tool supporting various voting formats including QV
* QuadraticVote
  * Platform implementing QV-specific algorithms

***

#### Localization Points for Social Issue Resolution

**Stakeholder-Based Voting**
* In Quadratic Voting, voters don't necessarily need to be funders. Voting eligibility can be set based on local residency or stakeholder status in the issue. For example, in local issues, residents and affected groups can be directly involved in decision-making
* In this format, verification of voting eligibility and appropriate identification of target participants becomes important

**Cultural Adaptation**
* Consider operational design that fits with Japanese citizen participation and decision-making processes. For example, implementing voting explanation meetings to raise awareness among local residents and transparent reporting systems for sharing results can be effective

**Promoting Education and Understanding**
* When introducing QV for the first time, ensure transparency and reliability by conducting explanations and simulations for voters
