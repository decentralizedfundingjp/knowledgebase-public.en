# Introduction: Quick Reference and Summary of Decentralized Funding Models

Each decentralized funding model offers flexibility for use in specific purposes and scenarios. This section provides a quick reference table summarizing the overview, application scenarios, required resources, and main examples of key models.

#### Quick Reference Table of Decentralized Funding Models

| Model | Overview | Application Scenarios | Required Resources | Main Examples |
| ----- | -------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Quadratic Voting | Voting method that increases cost for multiple votes to emphasize minority opinions | Determining funding priorities, policy proposals | Voting platform, governance support | Gitcoin, democratic decision-making projects |
| Quadratic Funding | Matching distribution method that amplifies the impact of small donations | Grant distribution, small donation support | Matching pool, voting tools | Gitcoin Grants, Giveth |
| Community Voting | Method where donors and citizens directly participate in decision-making to determine fund allocation | Local events, project selection | Voting platform, transparency tools | Yamakoshi Project, Snapshot voting |
| Delegated Review | Model where donors and citizens elect expert reviewers to distribute grants | Grant programs requiring expertise | Expert reviewers, voting platform | Compound Grants, specialized grant programs |

#### Model Overview

**Quadratic Voting (QV)**

Overview:\
A voting method where voters purchase votes and costs increase as more votes are cast. This makes it easier to reflect minority opinions.

Application Scenarios:

* Determining funding priorities
* Selecting from multiple policy proposals

Required Resources:

* Voting platform (e.g., Snapshot)
* Governance operation support

Main Examples:\
Project selection process in Gitcoin Grants and democratic decision-making projects.

***

**Quadratic Funding (QF)**

Overview:\
A model where additional funds from matching pools are distributed based on the square root of donor contribution amounts. The influence of small donations is amplified, reflecting more diverse opinions.

Application Scenarios:

* Grant distribution for small-scale projects and new initiatives
* Funding support for community activities and open source projects

Required Resources:

* Matching pool (secured by funders)
* Voting tools (e.g., Gitcoin platform)

Main Examples:\
Gitcoin Grants, UNICEF-Gitcoin pilot program.

***

**Community Voting**

Overview:\
A method where donors and citizens determine fund allocation through voting among project candidates. Residents and stakeholders can directly participate in decision-making.

![Community Voting Process](/img/models/communityvoting.jpg)

Application Scenarios:

* Budget allocation for local events
* Local projects and small grant programs

Required Resources:

* Voting platform (e.g., Snapshot)
* Tools to ensure project proposal transparency

Main Examples:\
Yamakoshi Project in Nagaoka City, Niigata Prefecture (utilizing NFTs and Snapshot).

***

**Delegated Review**

Overview:\
A model where donors and citizens elect expert reviewers who then distribute grants. Enables citizen participation while leveraging expertise.

![DDA Model Overview](/img/models/ddamodel.jpg)

Application Scenarios:

* Fields requiring high expertise such as healthcare and environmental conservation
* Large-scale grant programs

Required Resources:

* Reviewers with expertise in specialized fields
* Platform for voting and decision-making

Main Examples:\
Compound Grants, DDA (Delegated Domain Allocation) model.

The following sections will provide detailed implementation methods and examples for each of these models. We will also present specific steps and tools to help readers select and implement the model most suitable for their organizations.
