## Fund Distribution Model

**Quadratic Funding Implementation**

Quadratic Funding (QF) is a fund distribution model that amplifies the impact of small donations. This model distributes matching funds based on the number of donors, ensuring that projects supported by many people receive more funding.

1. Mechanism
   * Calculate the square root of each donor's contribution amount and sum these values.
   * Square the sum to determine the matching amount.
   * Projects with more small donors receive larger matching funds.

2. Effects
   * Engage a wide range of donors and promote diverse project funding.
   * Amplify the influence of small donors and support grassroots activities.

**Donation Incentive Programs**

1. GIVbacks Program
   * Donors receive GIV tokens for contributing to specific projects.
   * Tokens can be used for staking and project evaluation.

2. GIVpower
   * Stake GIV tokens to earn GIVpower.
   * Use GIVpower to boost projects and increase their visibility.

3. GURVES and GIVfi (Planned)
   * GURVES: A mechanism for building project-specific token economies.
   * GIVfi: A system utilizing unused donations to enhance the sustainability of the entire ecosystem.
