# UNICEF-Gitcoin Quadratic Funding Pilot

**Overview**

UNICEF and Gitcoin collaborated to pilot a new fund distribution model called "Quadratic Funding (QF)" for social impact projects. Utilizing blockchain technology, they pursued transparency and fairness. The system is characterized by its community-led decision-making that reflects the opinions of small donors.

**Year of Implementation**

2022

**Operators**

UNICEF Innovation Office, Gitcoin

**Target Areas**

* Social issue resolution projects utilizing blockchain and AI
* Specific examples: Financial access improvement, education and literacy enhancement, environmental protection, public health support

**Objectives**

* Promote fundraising for social impact projects
* Achieve fair and transparent fund distribution
* Support small-scale projects and region-specific activities
* Reflect donor intentions through community-led decision-making

**Results**

* Total funds raised: 132.5 ETH (50 ETH matching pool + 67.5 ETH + approximately 15,000 DAI)
* Number of donors: Over 15,500
* Supported projects (by country):
  * StaTwig (India), Somleng (Cambodia), XCapit (Argentina), Kotani Pay (Kenya)
  * Simple Map (Chile), Bioverse Labs (Brazil), Rahat (Nepal), AEDES (Philippines)

## Operational Process

**Project Selection**

Selected 10 projects from UNICEF Venture Fund's existing projects. Selection criteria were as follows:

* Utilization of blockchain technology or AI
* High social impact and innovation
* Projects certified as "Digital Public Goods"

**Matching Pool Setup**

UNICEF CryptoFund provided 50 ETH. Matching funds played a role in amplifying donor support amounts.

**Donation Period Setting**

* Period: December 9-21, 2022 (approximately 2 weeks)
* Utilized Gitcoin platform and conducted PR activities through SNS, newsletters, and partner networks

**Donation Acceptance and Distribution Calculation**

* Collected 67.5 ETH + approximately 15,000 DAI from the community and calculated distribution amounts using QF algorithm
* Designed so that projects with many small donations receive more support from matching funds

**Result Announcement and Fund Distribution**

* Published voting and fund distribution results on the blockchain to ensure transparency
* Distributed funds to each project and provided feedback to participants

**Follow-up**

* Collected feedback from projects and analyzed operational efficiency and challenges
* Identified future improvement points and considered model sustainability
