## Fund Distribution Model

**Innovation Phase (Proposal Stage)**

* Proposal Acceptance:
  * Uses the Ideascale platform ([Cardano Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/)) to accept proposals
  * Proposers create and submit detailed project plans including:
    * Project overview
    * Team composition
    * Required funding amount
    * Implementation plan and timeline
    * Expected outcomes and social impact
* Proposal Refinement:
  * Proposals receive community feedback and can be improved (not yet subject to formal review at this stage)
  * Proposals are refined based on feedback and final versions are submitted
* Categorization:
  * Proposals are classified into predefined categories (e.g., DeFi, DApps, education, social impact)

**Governance Phase (Voting Stage)**

* Voting Rights Assignment:
  * Voting rights are granted based on ADA holdings
  * Minimum 500 ADA required at snapshot time, with voting rights proportional to ADA holdings
* Proposal Evaluation and Review:
  * Proposals are evaluated by community reviewers based on:
    * Feasibility
    * Impact of the proposal
    * Risk assessment
    * Proposal value
  * Evaluations are scored from 1 to 5 stars, with overall results made public
* Voting Implementation:
  * Registered voters cast votes for or abstain on proposals through the Catalyst Voting app
  * Voting period typically set for about 2 weeks
* Result Tallying:
  * Proposal approval is determined based on voting results
  * Tallying results are publicly available on the blockchain for verification

**Implementation Phase (Project Execution Stage)**

* Funding for Selected Projects:
  * Approved proposals receive funding in stages based on milestones
  * Initial funding typically distributes 80% of planned milestones monthly, with remaining 20% paid upon milestone completion
* Project Progress Management:
  * Project teams submit "Proof of Achievement (PoA)" through the Milestone Module
  * PoA must include:
    * Status of each milestone and specific deliverables
    * Evidence of progress according to plan (e.g., photos, videos, reports, receipts)
  * Community reviewers or dedicated reviewers verify PoA, and next funding is provided if progress is deemed appropriate
* Final Report:
  * Final report submitted upon project completion, including project overview, outcomes, and achievement evaluation

**Key Features**

* Community Evaluation and Governance
  * Proposal evaluation and approval are entirely based on community voting
  * Community reviewers can participate if they meet certain conditions, classified into three levels based on experience (LV0-LV2)
* Milestone-based Funding
  * Funding is provided in stages rather than as a lump sum
  * This ensures progress transparency and enables appropriate resource allocation
* On-chain Management
  * All processes including proposals, voting, fund distribution, and progress reports are recorded on the blockchain for high transparency
* Feedback and Improvement Loop
  * After each funding round, participant feedback is analyzed and reflected in the next round, enabling continuous program improvement

## Potential Applications in Japanese Society

**Expected Effects**

* Introduction of Decentralized Fund Distribution
  * Utilizing a model where NPOs and social entrepreneurs post proposals and supporters directly vote to select them, achieving fair and transparent fund distribution
* Enhanced Transparency and Accountability
  * Using blockchain technology to visualize fund flows and voting results in real-time, fostering growth of a trust-based donation market
* Promoting Community Participation
  * Establishing systems where citizens and experts can participate in proposals and reviews, improving project quality through diverse perspectives
* Accelerating Innovation
  * Promoting innovation for social issue resolution through funding for new ideas and small-scale projects

**Implementation Challenges**

* Establishing Evaluation Criteria and Ensuring Transparency
  * Challenge: Difficulty in securing reviewers with specialized knowledge and ensuring fairness
  * Improvement Measures:
    * Publishing evaluation criteria in advance to ensure transparency
    * Introducing a system combining expert reviews with citizen peer reviews to enhance objectivity
    * Publishing evaluation criteria and results on-chain to strengthen transparency
* Long-term Visualization of Project Outcomes
  * Challenge: Lack of mechanisms for long-term tracking of project progress and impact
  * Improvement Measures:
    * Mandating regular progress reports and outcome disclosures, utilizing on-chain records
    * Building dashboards for data collection and analysis to enable quantitative evaluation of project outcomes
* Optimizing Voting Systems
  * Challenge: Risk of fairness being compromised due to voting rights being biased toward large holders
  * Improvement Measures:
    * Adopting voting systems emphasizing equality like "Quadratic Voting" to reflect small donors' opinions
    * Changing voting eligibility to be based not just on ADA holdings but also on regular community participation and contributions
    * Providing incentives (e.g., NFTs, participation certificates) to voters to increase participation rates
* Regulatory Compliance
  * Challenge: Need for harmonization with Japanese non-profit sector and donation-related regulations
  * Improvement Measures:
    * Collaborating with experts to develop guidelines for clearing legal issues in fund management and blockchain technology utilization
    * Developing systems meeting tax benefits and legal standards
* Cultural Adaptation
  * Challenge: Need for designing consensus-building and decision-making processes adapted to Japanese culture
  * Improvement Measures:
    * Emphasizing collaboration with offline community meetings and local events to create systems accessible to those unfamiliar with technology
