# Gitcoin

**Overview**

Gitcoin is a decentralized funding platform for open-source software development and public goods projects. It employs an innovative funding distribution model called Quadratic Funding (QF), which effectively leverages small donations to promote the sustainability of the open-source ecosystem.

**Year of Implementation**

2017

**Operators**

Gitcoin DAO

## Funding Distribution Model

**Quadratic Funding (QF) Mechanism**

* Basic Concept:
  * The square root of each donor's contribution is summed, and the square of this sum is distributed as matching funds
  * This gives small donations from many people greater impact
* Calculation Formula:
  * Matching amount = (Σ√contribution)²
  * Example: Comparing 10 people donating 1 ETH each vs. 100 people donating 0.1 ETH each
    * Former: (√1 × 10)² = 100
    * Latter: (√0.1 × 100)² = 1000
    * The latter receives 10 times more matching funds

**Operational Process**

1. Project Registration:
   * Submission of detailed project information
   * Setting goals and outcome metrics
   * Specifying required funding amount

2. Matching Pool Setup:
   * Sponsoring companies and individuals provide matching pools
   * Additional donations from the community are accepted

3. Donation Collection:
   * Fundraising through the Gitcoin platform
   * Donors can contribute to multiple projects simultaneously

4. Distribution Calculation:
   * Calculating matching funds based on QF algorithm
   * Determining final allocation for each project

5. Results Publication:
   * Publishing results on the blockchain
   * Ensuring transparency and verifiability
