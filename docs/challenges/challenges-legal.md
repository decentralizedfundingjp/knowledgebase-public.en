# Legal Challenges

1. Legal Treatment of Cryptocurrency Donations\
   While Japan's National Tax Agency has explicitly recognized cryptocurrency donations as specified donations, there are many areas where specific operational guidelines and declaration methods remain unestablished. Therefore, organizations implementing cryptocurrency donations need to design appropriate operational procedures with the cooperation of tax experts. Additionally, to maximize tax benefits, it is important to create guidelines that clearly explain the procedures donors can follow to receive deductions.

2. KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering)\
   For donations using cryptocurrency, it is necessary to ensure donor identity verification and transaction traceability based on the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds. Particularly, to prevent Sybil attacks (fraud using multiple fake accounts), implementing a robust identity verification system is essential. This includes the use of digital IDs and the adoption of multi-factor authentication.

3. Data Protection and Privacy\
   While blockchain offers high transparency, proper handling of personal information becomes a challenge. Particularly, it is necessary to comply with Japan's Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) and record only the minimum necessary data. Technical measures such as anonymizing transaction history data and encrypting donor information are recommended.
