# Operational Challenges

1. Cultural Challenges\
   In Japan, donation behavior is not necessarily common, and donors may not fully appreciate the benefits of participating in decision-making processes. Therefore, it is important to communicate the value of decentralized funding to donors in a concrete and understandable way. For example, it is effective to visualize the process through which donors create social impact through voting or establish mechanisms that allow direct verification of recipient activities.

2. Selection of Appropriate Distribution Models\
   While decentralized funding models have the potential to meet diverse needs, they are not suitable for all projects or challenges. For instance, in fields requiring specialized knowledge, expert review may be more necessary than community voting. Therefore, model application needs to be tailored to the nature of the project. It is important to establish a process to compare the advantages and disadvantages of models before implementation.

3. Accumulation of Success Stories and Learning\
   Since the implementation of decentralized funding in Japan is limited, it is important to learn from the successes and failures of pioneering cases. It is necessary to establish mechanisms to document specific steps of success stories and approaches to problem-solving, sharing them as resources that other organizations can reference.

4. Tools and Resources Preparation\
   The preparation of tools and resources that support actual operation is key to success. Specific examples include the utilization of Snapshot and Gitcoin, but it is necessary to provide guidelines and training programs for their effective use. Additionally, flexible customization is required according to the size and resources of each organization.
